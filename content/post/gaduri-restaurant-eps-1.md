After falling hard for a man who she believed would love her for all eternity, Ga Du Ri’s (Lee Joo Bin) outlook on life and love couldn’t have been more rosy. But when the man of her dreams leaves her with nothing but a shattered heart and broken dreams, Du Ri must find a way to pick herself up and move on. Summoning all her strength and her courage, Du Ri does exactly that. Starting a new chapter in her life, Du Ri opens “Ga Du Ri’s Sushi Restaurant” and quickly makes a name for herself, not only as a successful business owner, but also as an expert on dating and romance.

Drawn to her restaurant both for the food and the fiery-tempered owner with expert dating advice, people from far and wide come to visit Du Ri. Happy to feed the bellies of her customers as she also soothes their hearts, Du Ri offers help to any who ask. But when she catches a mysterious young man by the name of Cha Woo Bin (Hyuk), snooping around the place, Du Ri can’t help but be suspicious. Handsome as he may be, something about this man just feels off...

<!--inarticleads2-->

Learning the mysterious stranger is actually her neighbor, Du Ri is convinced he’s up to something. But what could a man who disregards the thoughts and opinions of everyone and lives life by his own set of rules want with her? Du Ri has no idea, but she’s determined to find out!


A clash of wit and will, “Gaduri Restaurant” is a 2020 romantic comedy directed by Seo Min Jung.

Zhao Qiao Yi and Yan Mo may have been high school classmates but the only thing they had in common was the desk they shared in class. One a top student, the other failing miserably, these two couldn’t have been more different and yet, it doesn’t take long for a strong bond to form between them.

Promising to study abroad together after high school, this unlikely pair seems to have the world before them. But when an unexpected family emergency forces Qiao Yi to back out on their plans the two drift apart and eventually lose touch.

Four years later, the long-lost friends are reunited and old flames are quickly rekindled. Finally willing to accept her feelings for Yan Mo, Qiao Yi moves to the city, determined to pick things up where they left off all those years ago; but with Yan Mo already in a relationship, Qiao Yi’s love seems destined to fail. But is it really?

Unbeknownst to Qiao Yi, Yan Mo hasn’t forgotten his old friend, nor the feelings he has for her. Unable to express those feelings, Yan Mo chooses to keep his actions and his feelings a secret. Always moving in the background, he works tirelessly to take care of his high school friend; but how long will he be able to keep this up before she realizes the truth?

~~ Adapted from the novel **“I Don’t Like This World, I Only Like You”** by Qiao Yi, which is also based on a true story of the author Qiao Yi and her husband.
